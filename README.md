# Detail_smart_watches_prediction
This project predicts smartwatch prices using various machine learning models after thorough data preprocessing and statistical analysis.
Techniques like feature scaling, outlier handling, and EDA were applied to prepare the data for modeling.
Multiple algorithms were tested, and hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize performance.
# ðŸŽ¯ The best accuracy was achieved using the Random Forest Regressor, making it the final model.
